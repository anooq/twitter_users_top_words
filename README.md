A python script using nltk and scikit-learn libraries to get the term frequency of a twitter user.

- export TWITTER variable with the path of the Directory where credentials.txt is present
- run python twitter_top_words.py twitter_username max_tweets_to_search max_top_words_to_print lemmatize(optional)
